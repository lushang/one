# BusinessOS Core Schema
This document lays the schema for the core data entities within BusinessOS.  It is oriented for Firebase clients and does not represent the schema in a traditional relational manner.



### Example JSON
A JSON file containing an example of this schema in action can be [found here](example.json).

### Naming Conventions
All fields start with a lowercase letter and should be camelCased instead of using-dasherization or having a FirstCapitalLetter.

### Default Properties
Unless otherwise noted, all core schema objects have:
- `id` (string, required) - The ID of the object.  _This can be omitted when the type is not a global entity, as noted under "Firebase Path" under the type description.  Additionally, oftentime the type does not have an explicit ID as a child property, but instead the key for a collection is its ID, e.g. the [Appointment][] under `/global/appointments/apptId1` has an `id` of `apptId1`, even though it doesn't have a child property `id`._

Unless otherwise noted, any object that has properties also has:
- `createdAt` ([Timestamp][], required) - When this object was created.  _It is the responsibility of the application creating the object to ensure this is set._
- `lastModifiedAt` ([Timestamp][], required) - When this object was last modified.  This is only required to be updated when a direct-child property of the object (e.g. a sibling property of this property) is modified.  _It is the responsibility of the application creating the object to ensure this is set._

### ObjectReferences
This is a many relationship reference to another object in the system.  It looks like `{entityId: true}`, and is the traditional way to keep a many relationship in Firebase.  For example, if we were referencing parts with IDs of `123` and `456`, the references would look like this:
```
{
  "123": true,
  "456": true
}
```

### Legacy Data and Mappings
Legacy-formatted data from Larson's system, prior to transformation into the BusinessOS schema, is stored in Firebase under the `/legacy` path.  Additionally, mappings between Larson's ID system and that of BusinessOS are stored for each entity under `/legacy-index`.  Each of these paths are listed below for relevant entities.

### Two-Way Data Bindings
ðŸš¨ serve to flag one half of a two-way relationship. As we are working within Firebase, we are not dealing with a traditional relational database. Instead, to ease the caching of data within applications and across multiple core schema objects, we have denormalized some of the data. For example, [Appointment][] has a one to many relationship with [Issue][]. Each [Appointment][] contains [ObjectReferences][] of [Issue][] while each [Issue][] has an `appointmentId` child property which contains the ID of the associated [Appointment][].

It is important when manipulating any of the fields involved in such relationships to remember to modify the fields of the associated objects at the other end of the relationship. In our example above, when we modify any of the [ObjectReferences][] on [Appointment][] we must also update the corresponding property, `appointmentId` in this case, on the [Issue][] object. ðŸš¨ are used within this document to flag such fields in an effort to reduce user error.

      }
    },
    "partId2": {
